# Intro to Rails- Overview
This video review lesson covers many of the concepts that you've learned about in this topic so far. To get the most out of these videos, first complete the Readings and Labs that come before it. 

## Summary
This video covers the flow of logic and the process it takes to get from the view to the browser. First, we need a model. Then, we need a controller with a corresponding action, a route to match the controller action, and the view that will be rendered in the browser when that controller action is hit.

Rails has the following components:
`ActiveRecordModels` - comprises methods for helping build your Rails application
`ActionController` - for controlling the flow of data between the model and the view
`Actionview` - rendering the view without having to write explicit html
